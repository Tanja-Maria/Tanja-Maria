## Hi! Here is what I'm working on ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Just learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails â€” now building my photography portfolio site to bring it all together.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently React
- ðŸ‘¯ Open to collaborating on educational apps that improve access to learning.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with growing as a developer and building meaningful learning tools.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about teaming up on coding projects â€” I love building things that connect science, learning, and creativity.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Check my Portfolio](https://tanja-maria.github.io/tanja-heinz-portfolio/)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me birdwatching, playing piano, or getting lost in nature.
