## Hi! Here is what I'm working on 👋


- 🔭 Just learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails — now building my photography portfolio site to bring it all together.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React
- 👯 Open to collaborating on educational apps that improve access to learning.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with growing as a developer and building meaningful learning tools.
- 💬 Ask me about teaming up on coding projects — I love building things that connect science, learning, and creativity.
- 📫 How to reach me: [Check my Portfolio](https://tanja-maria.github.io/tanja-heinz-portfolio/)
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I’m not coding, you’ll find me birdwatching, playing piano, or getting lost in nature.
